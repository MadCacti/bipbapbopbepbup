I got it partially right, but did not realize that multiple answers could be chosen. I understand though that if D and F were failing, then C would legitimately have no connection to A, B, and E and therefore information could not be sent from A to C given those circumstances.

I don't think I understood this question until reading the correction CB provided. The issue with my answer was that by converting each RGB into one singular value, we lose the original values wih no way of getting it back. C makes most sense as it still allows for a reversible method to retrieve the original data.

I just failed to read properly. I assumed it was a greater than sign, not a less than one.

I don't know how I got this one wrong either, but likely due to my lack of sleep and attention due to the robotics competition I was in.
