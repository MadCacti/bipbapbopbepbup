### Computing Bias
Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas...
- I do not believe the computer was designed intentionally to poorly detect minority races, but simply due to lack of resources in terms of gathering data for those races. This is likely due to HP only using their workplace for sources, which likely does not include many minority races. It definitely is harmful for it limits the system to only certain people of certain races, but I still do not believe it was intentional. It could and should be corrected through using crowd sourcing and gathering data from people of all races and ethnicities.

### Crowdsourcing
CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
- Crowdsourcing is already commonly used, especially for classes such as AP Statistics which require us to gather data from people at our school
- For CSP, a way is to gather opinions on what could be created or improved in a certain system.
What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
- Our project could definitely use and would actually require crowdsourcing, for we need people's input about their clubs to include it in our project, which revolves around helping ASB. 
- If students submit their own clubs, it gives us more time to focus on the website itself and not trying to go around and gather information.
