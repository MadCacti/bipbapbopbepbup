Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
- Dopamine issues are quite real, and the example of the WoW teen ruining his life momentarily shows that. People can get addicted to too much of it and place a lack of focus on their real world life. Personally, procrastination by doing other things(talking, playing, relaxing, probably sleeping) impacts me by driving time away from homework and study.
